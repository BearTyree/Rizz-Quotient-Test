You try to pay attention, but his voice fades into the background as your thoughts wander. You think about the work you need to do in other classes briefly. Then, as your thoughts about other classes begin to repeat, you begin to think about less important things. You look around the room and stare at the posters and decorations on the walls. You stare at a hand drawn poster of geometric shapes with the angles labeled. The shapes are unevenly spaced and slightly out of proportion. You imagine shifting all the shapes to be evenly spaced out on the poster, and you imagine squishing and pulling the shapes to have proper proportions. You continue thinking about this poster when, suddenly, Mr. Cronbach calls your name. You feel a sudden rush of terror as everyone turns, expecting you to answer a question on a topic you have not been paying any attention to. You pause not knowing what to do.

However, this endeavor is short lived as Mr. Cronbach’s voice begins to fade into the background. You look around the room again. This time, you look at the people in the class. Your mind wanders from random memories you have of each person. You notice Sarah. Sarah looks sick and tired of doing math; however, she is actively taking notes and paying attention. You had the same math class as Sarah three years ago and had a crush on her back then. You think about how funny it is that three years ago you spent every class thinking about Sarah, and yet you haven’t thought about her since then. The thought is about to leave your mind when you feel something in your chest. You notice how pretty Sarah is. Sarah has naturally curly hair in long slightly messy curls neatly bunched into a claw clip. Her skin is light caramel: the kind of tan that you only get being outside a lot. Sarah plays Softball, but she isn’t like most of the other girls on the team. Sarah is shy and extremely smart. You never got to talk much to her in the last math class you had with her.
